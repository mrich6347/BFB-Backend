## Hey, Notable Team! 👋

(Please note this project is still VERY much a work in progress, but gives a good idea of the direction I am headed in)

### 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **NestJS**: With TypeScript.
- **Supabase**: For Postgres and authentication.




### 📁 Key Directories
- **`/src/domains/`** - Each domain contains:
  - Controllers (HTTP handlers and routing)
  - Services (business logic and data operations)
  - DTOs (data validation and transformation)
  - Modules (dependency injection configuration)
- **`/supabase/migrations/`** - Database schema and data migrations
- **`/src/testing/`** - Testing scenario framework used to validate YNAB scenarios
